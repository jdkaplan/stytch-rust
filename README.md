# (Unofficial) Stytch API client for Rust

An unofficial library for making [Stytch] API requests in Rust.

[Stytch]: https://stytch.com

## Disclaimers

Although I am employed by Stytch, this is unrelated to my work there. I only
work on this in my free time (as needed to support another hobby project).
However, if Stytch wants to officially support this, I will gladly transfer
repo ownership.

Also, I am a Rust novice! The code you find here is probably not idiomatic or
efficient. I'm open to making it better if you share ideas or point out ways to
improve it.

## Support

This library is not officially supported by Stytch. Please use the issue
tracker for this repo to discuss all problems related to it. Do not contact
Stytch support unless the problem is reproducible without using this library.
